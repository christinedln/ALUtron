# ALUtron

**ALUtron** is a web-based simulation tool designed and developed to provide an interactive digital platform that simulates the core functionalities of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The system features an ALU model capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction, as well as logical operations including AND, OR, and NOT. Built with a React frontend and a Flask (Python) backend, ALUtron offers users an intuitive interface where binary values can be input through clickable buttons that toggle between 0 and 1. The tool dynamically processes these inputs and displays the results in real time, effectively demonstrating the behavior of an ALU at the binary level in an engaging and educational manner.

    - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    - macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
 
 3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install flask
    pip install flask-cors
    ```
 
 4. Run the Flask application:
    ```
